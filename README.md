ARIMA, GARCH, VaR
Utilized ARIMA analysis to capture time series dynamics, including ACF and PACF. Employed GARCH models with ADF test for volatility modelling. Analyzed data across various frequencies daily, weekly and monthly. Estimated 95% percentile Value at risk (VaR) for a two-asset portfolio using the variance-covariance method.
